# MachineMeta
A future program that fetches the decklists from Magic: the Gathering tournaments. It creates a "metagame pool" of archetypes and creates optimal builds based on the decks.

# K-means Cluster Algorithm
A K-means cluster algorithm finds archetypes.

# Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
A LDA algorithm finds archetypes.
